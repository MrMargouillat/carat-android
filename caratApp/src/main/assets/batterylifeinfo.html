        <h3>What does <i>Active Battery Life</i> mean?</h3>
        <p><i>Active Battery Life</i> approximates the amount of time your battery would last if you started from a full charge and discharged the battery at a rate that was the average of what Carat observed on your device during active use. This average rate excludes times that your device was idle and, as always, cannot account for behavior when Carat was not running.</p>
        <p>You may find that this number is much higher or lower than what you expect, but it more closely summarizes, statistically speaking, the intensity of your active device use.</p>
