<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In order to perform its function, Carat must periodically collect generic information about your device and how you are using it. This information includes the following:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">what apps are running,</span></li>
  <li class="li3"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">the % battery remaining,</span></li>
  <li class="li3"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">memory and cpu utilization,</span></li>
  <li class="li3"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">a unique device ID,</span></li>
  <li class="li3"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">the battery state (e.g., plugged in), and</span></li>
  <li class="li3"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">the OS version and phone model.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We <b><i>DO NOT</i></b> collect any personally identifying information: no names, no email addresses, no private data from other apps, and so on. The app uses <b><i>a low-power feature of Location Services</i></b> to be notified of significant changes in your location and to take samples. Carat does <b><i>NOT</i></b> use GPS (we never record your absolute location) or run in the background, period. Carat has a <a href="http://github.com/carat-project/carat"><span class="s3">public github repository</span></a>, so you don't need to take our word for it.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After collecting data about your device for <b><i>a week or more</i></b>, it will give you personalized recommendations. If your battery is running down quickly, it isn't Carat's fault, but we hope it will help you discover the real culprit.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Carat periodically sends this information to our servers, where we do math on it and subsequently share the results with you. Carat tries to do all of this unobtrusively. Although we encourage you to open Carat every now and then so it can send us new data, you can pretty much forget it's running until you'd like to investigate a battery problem.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Carat is an academic research project. We reserve the right to publish our results and to release the data into the public domain. (Remember: the data does not identify you in any way.) We will never sell your data or use it to advertise to you.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We respect your privacy and value your trust. When you downloaded Carat, you agreed to our <a href="http://carat.cs.helsinki.fi/eula.html"><span class="s3">EULA</span></a>, which contains additional information. If you have any questions or concerns, <a href="mailto:carat@cs.helsinki.fi"><span class="s3">just ask</span></a>.</span></p>
