        <h3>What are these numbers?</h3>
        <p><b>Battery life impact</b> tells the amount of battery life that fixing the hog/bug is expected to yield. Fixing hogs means killing the app and using it less, while fixing a bug may mean just restarting the app, updating it to the latest version, or changing some of the app's settings.</p>
        <p><b>Samples</b> shows how many measurements we have of this app, across all users. More samples means the app is common and its energy use well known.
        </p>
        <p>As there are more samples, the <b>Measurement error</b> (in minutes) will decrease.</p>
	<p><b>Measurements without</b> shows how many measurements Carat has that do not include the app in question. Both measurements with and without the app are required to ascertain its energy behavior.</p>
