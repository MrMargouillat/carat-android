        <h3>If killing the app does not work:</h3>
        <p>Click App Manager above. Click the Running tab.<p>
        <!--<center><img src="Manage-Android2.2.png"></center>-->
        <p>If necessary, scroll up or down to locate the app you want to close. When you've found it, click it. You should see something like this:<p>
        <center><img src="Kill-Android2.2.png"></center>
        <p>Press Force Stop or Stop. Once you are done killing apps, press the back button to get back to Carat. If you were trying to restart the app, now simply open it again, as usual.</p>
        <p>If the app keeps coming back, it can be a widget that you may want to remove from your home screen, or a system app that is not supposed to be killed.</p>
